- make distcheck pass. Now it fails on VPATH-mode (http://www.gnu.org/software/automake/manual/html_node/Checking-the-Distribution.html)
- dlopen: show all libraries, properly resolving path
- show initial STDIN/STDOUT as R/W. To handle cases as: fxtrace ... cat </etc/fstab
- when installing as root, install to standard path with set-UID on .so. This will allow LD_PRELOAD-ing for set-UID binaries
- trace creating hardlinks
- optionally log unsuccessfull calls too. At least on --debug.
( - do not allocate any memory within fxtrace.so since one-space-with-binary. UNDER QUESTION )
- provide flock -n \d+ semantics. Will be usefull in scenario
